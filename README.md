I do not own all of the work, this was a project done in Codecademy. All the work I did was pertaining to the lessons for Color in UI, I followed the 
instructions of the project and made my changes accordingly.

This lesson was to teach the use of Color in UI, with regards to call-t0-actions and guiding users on the website.
